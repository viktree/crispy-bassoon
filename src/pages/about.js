      My name is Vikram Venkataramanan. I am a software developer based in
      Toronto. After finishing up my CompSci degree, I dabbled around a bit
      writing low-level code for high-performance software defined radios.
      Nowadays, I spend my time constructing and maintaining ecobeeâ€™s
      subscription platform.
